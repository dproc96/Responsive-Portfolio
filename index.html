                <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile">

                <p>I come to the world of Web Development with a short but varied background. I cut my teeth as a video and photo editor 7 years ago. From there, I began to work in graphic design where I had my first experience with web design on Sqoarespace. After that, I started doing social media marketing and worked on a website using Concrete5 and code written by someone else. I currently work in quality assurance where I specialize in report design (a.k.a. using Google Sheets and their built-in Javascript framework to make spreadsheets for my colleagues).</p>

                <p>In my undergraduate degree, I studied Economics and Film History. Not the most obvious background for web development but I like to think it gives me a more outside the box mentality. Programing runs in my family though: my father went from studying Philosophy to programming, my mother went from Insurance to programming and my sister turned from Linguistics to programming. I think I am most excited to work in the back end because I do a lot of data manipulation in my current position and have a lot of fun with it</p>
